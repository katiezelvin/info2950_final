    "What factors affect if a U.S domestic flight will be delayed or cancelled? Which flights are most likely to be delayed or cancelled? Are there airlines that are better than others in terms of number of delays and delay times? Can flight history be used to predict the delay time of future flights?\n",

We will use values such as various values such as Cancelled, Diverted, Month, Operating Airline, Distance and originState and many more to see if we can predict if a flight will be delayed or cancelled, and possibly by how much."

    "- Flight delays are something most of us who have traveled by air have experienced. Regardless of the reason for delays, they pose a huge inconvenience for travelers. These datasets were created so that relevant analysis can be done on the vast amount of data available on flight travel. This would help generate valuable insight into the cause and effect of flight delays. Gaining insight into this would help airline companies, airports, and passengers. \n",

These are all  govermental organizations and public websites, that collect data for public use. In terms of what might have influenced what data was observed and recorded, we can say that this is readily available non personal, not private data that would not breach and acts of privacy. As opposed to any personal data, that contains personal information like phone number, age, name, salary or home address. \n",
    "Moreover, some of the airports and airlines operate international flights, this type of data would be ignored or any private jets which go to private airports would be ignored. Even flights that donâ€™t carry passsengers and only carry goods would be ignored for this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Over what timeframe was the data collected?__\n",
    "The flight delay prediction data was collected from 2018 - 2022. However for this analysis we only used data from 2022. \n",
    "The List of US airports data has no time attribute to it, but was last updated on kaggle 3 years ago from 2023. \n",

    "The flights delay prediction and list of US airports was obtained from online sources which was then collected and uploaded by the creator on kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "__What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?__\n",
    "We first concatenated the two datasets with the first half of 2022 and the second half of 2022, which we named flights_2022. Because these are domestic flights, we dropped the 'country' column. Then, we joined the dataset of airports to flights_2022 using duckdb SQL, while selecting only the columns of these tables that were relevant. Then, while scanning through the arrival minute times, we realized some values were negative, so we converted those to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "We originally had scraped weather data as well, which is included in a separate file, but we are no longer using this. We may scrape weather data from a different API in the future and join it to flights_2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?__\n",
    "The main dataset is a dataset from Kaggle so people have used it for competitions and exploration. However, we do not have access to their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has also been a lot of analysis done on this topic, but from a different dataset at different times.\n",

    "Our project explored what factors best predict flight delays and cancellations in the United States. We used flight data from 2018 because it was a complete dataset from a year that did not overlap with COVID which would produce different trends in delays and cancellations. Our dataset included nearly 5 million flights which was too large to work with, so we took a 10% random sample of the data. Each row represented a flight, and included columns that defined the origin and destination airports and their locations, the length of the delay of the flight, whether the flight was cancelled or not cancelled, and other variables which could be used as predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first hypothesis was that flights with a larger distance, calculated from the longitudes and latitudes of the origins and destinations, are more likely to be delayed than flights with a smaller distance. We conclude that flights with a larger distance are not more likely to be delayed than flights with a smaller distance. There is no direct correlation between flight distance and delay time of flights. Our data showed that flight delay times are very concentrated around very slight delays, so it is difficult to make predictions about flight delay time from just the distance between airports because predicted values were concentrated around the same delay times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our second hypothesis was that flights scheduled during the winter months(December, January, February) are more likely to be delayed compared to flights scheduled during other months of the year. While our initial hypothesis posited that flights scheduled during the winter months would be more prone to delays, the results of our logistic regression model have introduced interesting nuances. Contrary to expectations, certain months outside the winter season (May, Aug and July) exhibit a higher likelihood of delays, challenging our initial assumptions."

    "2) Because of US weather api issues we were not able to get any data on US weather. This created issues as we were not able to improve our analysis and add more depth to our analysis on weather data. This affected our analysis as we were not able to make a more comprehensive analysis and predict to see if flight delays and cancellation is affe cted by weather. \n",
    "3) Another issue we faced was that our flight cancellation and delay column most of the entries are false. When we convert it to a binary, most of the values will be zero. This creates an issue when we trained our logistic regression. Creating class imbalance, where the majority class (class 0, likely representing non-delayed flights) dominates the training dataset. This imbalance can lead the model to be biased towards predicting the majority class, resulting in high accuracy but poor performance on the positive class (delayed flights). "

    "Future research could include using a multiple regression with more variables in addition to distance to see if we can get a more accurate prediction of the delay times. Additionally, this could include weather data if a future research study had funding to purchase data from the weather API. We could also use international data rather than just data of flights in the US. "
